# Cyslistic Case Study
This repository contains the completed Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study, a pivotal project within the Google Data Analytics Certification program. In this project, I took on the role of a junior data analyst at Cyclistic and worked through the structured data analysis process, utilizing spreadsheets, SQL, R, and Tableau.
